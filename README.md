* Leaflet Project 

The purpose of this little project is to use React Leaflet to create interactive map with markers and popups. I have integrated GEOJson file that has coordination for showing specific markers.

I have also used React Router to be able to change between components so that one component is showing map with markers and popups and on the other components showing data table from that GEOJson file.

This was a little assignment I was given and wanted to finish this so I would learn on how to implement and work with React Leaflet and also working with React Router.
